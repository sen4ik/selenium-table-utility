<td>Low-sulfide Au-quartz veins (Cox and Singer, 1986; model 36a).</td>
<td>   Three quartz veins, the Granite Mountain, Independence, and Skyscraper, cut Late Cretaceous quartz diorite of the Willow Creek Pluton. The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954).   Granite Mountain vein as Capps (1915) described averages about 22 inches thick, but pinches and swells. It is oriented N 14 to 20 W, and dips 10 to 42 SW. A few inches of gouge bounds the vein. The Granite Mountain vein contains free gold, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and specks of unidentified sulfide. All parts of this vein are reported to yield free gold by panning (Katz, 1911). This vein was thought to be an extension of the vein at Gold Cord mine (ARDF number AN007), but is probably not the same vein unless it is displaced at least 300 ft by transverse faulting (Ray, 1954). The Skyscraper vein (also seen in Martin mine, ARDF number AN006) is up to 4 ft thick, strikes approximately south and dips 10 to 40 W (Ray, 1933). Stoll (1944) described the Independence vein: The vein follows a fault zone and has a maximum thickness of 8 ft. The quartz vein contains calcite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, scheelite, sphalerite, galena, and gold (last mineral deposited). Typical orientation of the vein is N 10 W, dipping 25 W (dip ranges from 55 W to 2 E). Vein attitude modified by at least three &#39;rolls,&#39; or marked changes in the strike of the vein, that trend NW-SE. Vein is thickest where dip is lowest, highest gold values occur where dip is greatest. Gold occurs in zones of microbrecciation of quartz. Internal structures are the result of minor faulting during and after mineralization. Many minor faults cut vein cleanly rather than drag vein. The Independence vein is cut off at the south end of the main workings by a regional fault (Martin fault). The vein is not found south of the fault, possibly being displaced upward and eroded (Ray, 1954).</td>
<td>   Staked in July(?) 1907 by William and Eugene Bartholf. Capps (1915) reported that the first mill in the district was put into operation on site in 1908. In 1909, the Alaska Gold Quartz Mining Company drove an adit 140 feet following the Granite Mountain vein. A 3-stamp mill was installed and operated part of the season. Operations were suspended, after ore changed from free-milling to base ore, pending installation of a concentrating table (Brooks, 1910). By 1910, the adit was driven an additional 10 feet and Katz (1911) reported the installation of a 2-stamp water-powered prospecting mill without concentrators. An additional 150 ft of adit was driven in 1911 with 1,500 ft of open-cut work (Brooks, 1912). Over 230 tons of ore were treated and tailings were stockpiled as no concentrator was in use on site (Brooks, 1912). Improvements in 1913 included: a 4-stamp mill (8.5 tons/day capacity), two aerial tramways extending from the ore bodies to the mill, several hundred feet of adit tunnels and stopes, and a number of open cuts on ore body outcrops (Capps, 1914). A concentrating table was in use by 1913.     Independence Gold Mining Company took over the property from Alaska Gold Quartz Mining Company in 1914; 500 to 600 ft of aggregate underground work was completed by the end of 1914 (Brooks, 1915). Workings (Capps, 1916) included extending the main tunnel, on the Granite Mountain vein, by driving it a total of 540 ft by the end of 1915. The Independence vein was opened in 1914 and 1915 by tunnels 105 ft long and 15 ft long, and by 240 ft of outcrop stripping. Underground development in 1916 consisted of driving a 300 ft adit designed to crosscut the ore body at depth (Brooks, 1918). A new tram was also built to connect the lower level of the mine with the mill. There was no mining in 1917 as operating costs were anticipated to be too high to yield a profit. However, some ore from the Gold Cord (ARDF number AN007) was milled in the Independence mill in 1917 (Capps, 1919).  In the early 1920s, the mine was investigated and developed (from the Willow Creek side of the divide) by Kelly Mines Company. Development under Kelly Mines included deeper exploration for auriferous quartz veins including crosscut tunnels below the previous workings. Due to faulting the new tunnels failed to expose sufficient ore. Kelly Mines milled ore sporadically between 1920 and 1924 using the Martin (ARDF number AN006) mill and the stamp mill on the Independence property. The company did not renew the lease for the property (Cohen, 1982). Apparently, the property was inactive from the mid- to late-1920s through the early 1930s. Around 1933 to 1935, the operators of the Gold Cord mine (ARDF number AN007), William Horning and Charles Bartholf, leased the Independence property and milled Independence ore in the Gold Cord mill. A single aerial tram connected the Independence mine workings to the Gold Cord mill (Smith, 1934).   Alaska-Pacific Mines, Inc., managed by Walter W. Stoll, purchased a lease with an option-to-buy on the Independence property in 1935, and began operating the mine in June 1936. The Martin mine (ARDF number AN006) was also operated under lease by Alaska-Pacific Mines in 1936. In October of 1936 Alaska-Pacific Mines sub-leased the Independence mine to the Wasilla Mining Company. Wasilla Mining Company continued operating the mine after Alaska-Pacific Mines purchased the Independence mine in 1937. In February 1938, the Wasilla Mining Company and Alaska-Pacific Mines, Inc. consolidated as Alaska-Pacific Consolidated Mining Co. or APC (Stoll, 1939). With consolidation, the Independence and Martin mines came under a single operator. By the early 1940s, the APC operated the Independence, Martin (ARDF number AN006), and the Gold Bullion (ARDF number AN004) mines. Between 1936 and 1942, APC processed 112,259 tons of ore yielding 140,974 ounces of gold (Pitt, 1942). In October 1942, the War Production Board determined that gold mines were nonessential to the war effort and ordered them closed. Independence mine continued operating because of the presence of scheelite, which coincidentally occurred with the gold ore. For a short time, the mine was able to produce gold and scheelite. Scheelite was hand picked with the use of ultra-violet lights. The War Production Board ordered production from the mine to cease by the fall of 1943. During 1944 and 1945 APC was permitted to continue development work and about 2,350 tons of ore was processed. Dissension from within and without APC slowed down reopening the mine after the war. Due to serious cash problems, the mine was forced to close again in 1946 (Stoll, 1997). The mine stood idle until the spring of 1949 when Walter W. Stoll returned to reopen the mine. Walter Stoll died that spring and the operation was taken over by his son, William M. Stoll. The revival was short lived, APC closed down operations in 1951 and offered mining machinery and equipment for sale in 1958.   With rising gold prices beginning in the mid-1970s, Enserch Exploration Inc. (equally owned by Enserch Corporation and Dallas, Texas businessman Starkey Wilson) began acquiring properties in and around the Independence mine area. Holdings extended for over four miles west of the Independence camp, including the Lucky Shot (ARDF number AN002), War Baby (ARDF number AN003), Gold Bullion (ARDF number AN004), Martin (ARDF number AN006), and Mabel (ARDF number AN008) properties. Coronado Mining Corporation under C. Hawley began cleaning out the old APC water tunnel at Independence in the summer of 1979 (Stoll, 1997). The Independence mine began producing gold again during the summer of 1982. An access decline to the underground workings was completed from the Willow Creek drainage and a new 200 tons per day mill was built on Craigie Creek, a location suitable for receiving feed from various nearby sources (Pittman and Mulligan, 1983). In November 1982 Coronado suspended operations.  Reasons for the closure were &#39;problems in the mill,&#39; but Enserch hoped to re-open the mine when the problems were solved. But the project remained closed and reports are that estimates of gold potential were overly optimistic (Woodman, 1983). Or as Stoll (1997) put it, Coronado&#39;s drilling campaign apparently &#39;missed whatever was there.&#39;   In the end, well over 8 miles of underground workings were dug in the Independence mine.</td>

In the early days of the district, these were more or less contiguous if somewhat separate properties at least in name but they are being explored and developed as a single property (Full Metal Minerals, 2010a; Stevens, 2010). The deposit consists of quartz veins along shear zones that cut the Late Cretaceous Willow Creek Pluton, which is jointed and sheeted near the surface but less so underground. The pluton is zoned; the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite.   The classic mesothermal quartz veins at the Lucky Shot occur along shear zones that exhibit both ductile and brittle properties; the shear zones are up to 100 feet wide. The veins are between two major northeastward-dipping transverse faults. The quartz veins that were mined prior to WWII were generally 2 to 4 feet wide; they strike about  N 80 E, and dip about 40 N. Post mineral faults offset the veins up to 800 feet and the quartz in the veins often is fractured. There are two generations of quartz veins. An older group is generally parallel to southwest-dipping joints in the pluton. These veins contain three different suites of ore minerals: 1) chalcopyrite, pyrite, and arsenopyrite; 2) pyrite and stibnite; and 3) sparse pyrite, sphalerite, and minor gold. The younger and economically important veins occur along the major shear zones. Pyrite is the most common ore mineral in them; arsenopyrite and galena are often present; scheelite is locally present; and there are trace tellurides including nagyagite, altaite, and possibly coloradoite. The wall rocks are intensely altered near the veins. Adjacent to the veins, the wall rock is bleached white or gray-green with much sericite, clay, and carbonates. There is an outer zone of propylitic alteration. There are two periods of mineralization, 66 Ma and 55 to 57 Ma (Madden-McGuire and others, 1988; Harlan, 2003). Fluid inclusion studies and isotope geochemistry indicate that the temperature of the ore forming fluids was 300 to 325 degrees (Burleigh, 1987, Silberman and others, 1978).   During the mining before WWII, the stopes along the vein averaged about 5 feet thick, the grade of the ore was typically a half ounce to two ounces per ton and the workings only went down to 500 feet or less below the surface (Stevens, 2010). The work since 2005 has revealed that there are much wider mineralization, even if at lower grade, and that the mineralization extends well below and beyond the old workings. The mineralization at the Lucky Shot has been traced for more than 4,000 meters horizontally, has a vertical extent of at least a thousand meters and has an average width of about 400 meters (Stevens, 2010). Over the last half century or more there have been several estimates of the gold resources of the Lucky Shot Mine. Most are now of little more than historic interest in view of the recent exploration. A resource estimate on the Coleman Zone was completed by Miranda Gold Corp. in September 2014 (Linebarger, 2014).   In March 2016, Miranda and Gold Torrent announced an updated resource estimate for the Willow Creek project, including measured and indicated resources of 121,500 ounces of gold averaging 18.3 grams of gold per tonne and 12,100 ounces of silver averaging 1.8 grams of silver per tonne contained in 206,600 tonnes of material. Inferred mineral resources include 59,000 tonnes of material that contain 35,150 ounces of gold averaging18.5 grams of gold per tonne and 2,900 ounces of silver averaging 1.5 grams of silver per tonne (Black and others, 2016a).</td>
<td>   Gold was discovered in the Lucky Shot area in 1918 and mining began in 1922 (Stoll, 1997, is a detailed history of the mining at the Lucky Shot and other mines in the Willow Creek district.). Mining continued fairly regularly until 1942; the mine did not reopen after WWII. Ensearch Exploration Inc. obtained the property in 1979 and did considerable underground work and exploration drilling. A 100-ton-a-day mill was built and about 10,000 tons of ore was milled. Several companies continued exploration into the early 1990s and another 1,000 tons of ore was mined. In 2005, Full Metals Minerals Corp. began intensive exploration of the Lucky Shot (Full Metal Minerals Corp., 2010a). Through 2008, Full Metal Minerals diamond drilled 164 holes; sampled the old dumps and underground workings; rehabilitated, improved, and sampled the old underground workings; and mined a bulk sample for metallurgical testing. In 2009, they drilled another 27 holes with several notable intercepts with 24.14 to 102.00 grams of gold per tonne (Full Metal Minerals Corp., 2010b). In the late Fall of 2009, they finalized an option agreement with Harmony Gold Corporation to continue exploring the property (Full Metal Minerals Corp., 2009). In November 2013, Miranda Gold Corp. (Miranda) entered a lease agreement with Alaska Hardrock Inc. and the following year Miranda completed a resource estimate on the Coleman Zone (Linebarger, 2014).</td>

<td>   A National Instrument 43-101 compliant resource estimate on the Coleman Zone was completed by Miranda Gold Corp. in September 2014. The resource was calculated using a 7 gram per tonne gold cutoff grade. The measured resource was calculated to be 11,500 tonnes at 28.5 grams per tonne gold, yielding 10,500 troy ounces. The indicated resource was calculated to be 67,200 tonnes at 23.9 grams per tonne gold, yielding 51,600 troy ounces. The inferred resource was calculated to be 5,300 tonnes at 24.2 grams per tonne gold, yielding 4,100 troy ounces (Linebarger, 2014).   In March 2016, Miranda and Gold Torrent announced an updated resource estimate for the Willow Creek project, including measured and indicated resources of 121,500 ounces of gold averaging 18.3 grams of gold per tonne and 12,100 ounces of silver averaging 1.8 grams of silver per tonne contained in 206,600 tonnes of material. Inferred mineral resources include 59,000 tonnes of material that contain 35,150 ounces of gold averaging18.5 grams of gold per tonne and 2,900 ounces of silver averaging 1.5 grams of silver per tonne (Black and others, 2016a). All estimated resources are based on a cutoff grade of 5.0 grams of gold per tonne, a long-term gold price of $1,265 per ounce, and assumed metallurgical recoveries of 80 percent. Improved understanding of the geologic controls on mineralization resulted in a significant increase in the mineral-resource estimate for the Willow Creek project. In total, mineral resources at the Willow Creek project include eight veins in the Coleman area and two veins in the Lucky Shot area (AN002), and are based on information from 174 drill holes. Potential exists to increase the mineral resources through drilling down-dip extensions of the Coleman and Lucky Shot area, and the exploration targets in the War Baby (AN 003) and Murphy areas along strike to the east (Athey and Werdon, 2017). In July 2016, a newly completed NI 43-101 preliminary feasibility study reported proven and probable mineral reserves of 93,274 ounces of gold contained in 207,000 tonnes of material grading an average of 14.0 grams of gold per tonne (Black and others, 2016b).   The Willow Creek project is currently being developed through a joint-venture partnership between Miranda Gold Corp. and Gold Torrent Inc., with Gold Torrent currently earning a 70 percent equity interest through the funding of the first $10 million in development costs (Athey and Werdon, 2017).</td>

<td>   Located in 1918, The War Baby Mine quickly saw the erection of a small mill. The first production from the mine occurred in 1919 after two short tunnels and a crosscut  were driven. Willow Creek Mines took over the property in 1921. The War Baby was mined, with interruptions, from 1919 until 1940. There were over 2,000 ft of underground workings on 3 levels. Ray (1933) reported that production from 1922 through 1927 was from a single stope measuring 175 by 250 ft with a maximum width of 10 to 12 ft. The ore mined through 1927 averaged 2.18 ounces of gold per ton (Ray, 1933). There may have been some copper production. By 1950, the mine had long since closed and the workings were inaccessible (Ray, 1954).   Chapin (1920) reported that four or five parallel quartz veins at the War Baby Mine cut the Late Cretaceous Willow Creek Pluton. The pluton is zoned: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Wallrock alteration is intense within a few inches of the veins but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the veins.   The veins at the War Baby Mine strike N 80 E, and dip 17  to 62 NW; they are found in a 33-feet-wide zone and vary in thickness from 1 to 15 inches. The veins appear to belong to a single system that locally branches in the hanging wall. The footwall is marked by slickensides that separate the lode from fresh country rock. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and chloritization occurs in the outer parts of the alteration zone (Ray, 1954). The veins are a continuation of those at the Lucky Shot mine (AN002) although offset 600 to 700 feet along a prominent fault. The ore mined through 1927 averaged 2.18 oz/ton Au (Ray, 1933).   The War Baby mine was consolidated with the Lucky Shot Mine (CH002) and mined by the same company before 1942. In 2005, Full Metal Minerals Corp. began a intensive exploration that included the Lucky Shot Mine, the War Baby Mine, and adjacent ground beyond either of them. The War Baby is now only a block within that larger deposit that retains the name Lucky Shot.

<td>   The Gold Bullion Mine was developed on one or more quartz veins 1.5 to 14 feet thick that are intermittently exposed over 3,000 feet of strike length and have an average grade of about 1.7 ounces of gold per ton (Capps, 1915). The nearly horizontal quartz veins at the Gold Bullion contain gold, small amounts of pyrite, chalcopyrite, other sulfides, and are stained by copper carbonates. The veins cut tonalite and quartz diorite of the Willow Creek pluton, which has been dated at 73-74 Ma (Stevens, 2010; Madden-Mcguire and others, 1988). At least three normal faults are known to displace the veins (Stevens, 2010). Visible slickensides and gouge are along the vein walls (Katz, 1911). Capps (1915) reported cinnabar along cracks in quartz in one tunnel. According to Chapin (1920), most mining was on one vein that strikes N 10 E, and dips 14 NW. The ore averaged about 1.7 ounces of gold per ton (Ray, 1954). A K-Ar age from muscovite in a quartz-sericite selvage adjacent to a gold-bearing vein nearby was 56 Ma, early Paleocene (Silberman and others, 1978). Wall rock alteration is intense within a few inches of the veins, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz vein. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization, and in the outer parts of the alteration zone the wall rock is chloritized (Ray, 1954).   An adjacent property, the Ready Bullion vein was discovered during mining at the Gold Bullion Mine. Workings were extended to it from the Ready  Bullion in 1937 (Roehm, 1938; Stevens, 2010). The Ready Bullion vein was 12 to 18 inches thick and could be traced for three claims. It was considered to be the down-dip extension of the Gold Bullion.   In early 2010, the Gold Bullion Mine was part of a large block of claims that was being explored by the Harmony Gold Corporation (Stevens, 2010). In 2014 Miranda Gold Corp. collected soil samples and vein samples that identified significant anomalies potentially extending the fault limit of the Gold Bullion vein and provided new targets for vein segments between the Murphy and Bullion Mountain veins (Linebarger, 2014).</td>
<td>   The Gold Bullion Mine was staked by William Bartholf in 1907 (Capps, 1915). From 1909 to 1927, mine was the second largest producer in the district (Ray, 1933). The first ore from the property was from an open cut on a vein outcrop. The ore was carried by pack horse to the mill 1,600 ft below on Craigie Creek. The 2-stamp mill with a capacity of six tons a day was built in 1909 (Stoll, 1997). A 5-stamp mill was added to the property in 1911, increasing the mill capacity to 21 tons of ore per day. By 1915, a cyanide plant, five tunnels, numerous open cuts, several aerial trams, and other surface improvements were reported (Capps, 1915). According to Capps (1919), there was a total of 5,220 feet of  underground workings. The old tailings were cyanided in 1939-1940 and several thousand dollars of gold was recovered  (Ray, 1954).   The Ready Bullion was also mined in the mid-1970s by Dan Renshaw (personal communication, 1998). He mined from surface pits along the ridge above the Ready Bullion adits from frozen, near-surface portions of the vein that had been left in place during early mining to protect the underground workings. Several hundred tons were mined that ran 3 to 4 ounces of gold per ton. The ore was trucked to the Gold Cord mill (AN007) on upper Fishhook Creek, where the last of it was milled in 1977. Mining stopped with additional ore in sight when the property was folded into a consolidation of a number of properties when gold was approaching $800 per ounce. Subsequently, the price of gold retreated to a level that curtailed the effort and there was no additional production from the Ready Bullion. Access to the property during this work was by a steep, zigzag road upward from the head of Little Willow Creek.   In early 2010, the Gold Bullion Mine was part of a large block of claims that was being explored by the Harmony Gold Corporation (Stevens, 2010). In November 2013, Miranda Gold Corp. (Miranda) entered a lease agreement with Alaska Hardrock Inc. and collected 234 soil samples and three vein samples in the summer of 2014 that identified significant anomalies potentially extending the fault limit of the Gold Bullion vein and provided new targets for vein segments between the Murphy and Bullion Mountain veins (Linebarger, 2014).</td>

The main vein is as wide as 18 ft and is made up of quartz, gouge, and altered tonalite (Ray, 1954). Ore concentrated at intersections of main vein and smaller cross veins. The stringer veins are displaced and broken up into distinct blocks by major post-mineralization faults. Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling (Ray, 1954). The wall rock has been intensely altered with ankerite, kaolinite, and secondary quartz (Ray, 1933). Metallic minerals include pyrite, arsenopyrite, tetrahedrite, galena, nagyagite, gold, and sparse scheelite (Ray, 1933).   Assay of channel samples indicate a 12 ft sample of quartz stringers in altered country rock has 1.0 oz/ton Au, 8 to 12 inches of massive quartz yielded 0.45 oz/ton Au, and 2.5 ft zone of quartz and altered country rock show 2.3 oz/ton Au (Ray, 1933).</td>
<td>   An adit was driven 40 ft to vein and then 56 ft along vein in attempt to find the ore shoot exposed at surface (Capps, 1919). By 1920, the adit was driven 300 ft (Chapin, 1920). A mill was installed, and both mine and mill operated in 1922 (Brooks and Capps, 1924). The first gold from the mine was produced in 1922. The Fern Gold Mining Company milled its last ore in 1928. Explored by more than 4,000 ft of underground workings plus stopes on 2 levels by 1931 (Ray, 1933). Workings extended beneath a tunnel of the adjoining Talkeetna mine (ARDF number AN025), but do not connect. In 1931, Thomas McDougal leased the property and worked the mine as the Fern Gold Leasing Company (Stoll, 1997).  Mining stopped in 1941 and McDougal gave up the lease in 1945. During the time from 1931 to 1941, two new levels of adits were driven with over 3,000 ft aggregate length. In 1945, A.G. Dodson obtained a lease for the property and operated the mine until his death in late 1950. A mill and cyanide plant were present on the property, however the mill was destroyed by fire in 1946.  A new mill was completed in 1948.   Assay of channel samples indicate a 12 ft sample of quartz stringers in altered country rock has 1.0 oz/ton Au, 8 to 12 inches of massive quartz yielded 0.45 oz/ton Au, and 2.5 ft zone of quartz and altered country rock show 2.3 oz/ton Au (Ray, 1933).</td>

<td>   The Martin mine is the site of the first lode discovery in the district, 1906. At the point of discovery the lode was separated into two quartz bodies about 15 feet apart. The top body showed 5 feet of milling ore and below it from 4 to 10 feet of ore (Capps, 1915). The two major veins, Homestake and Skyscraper veins, cut quartz diorite of the Late Cretaceous Willow Creek Pluton and are in shear zones and are separated by a transverse fault. The Homestake vein, probably a continuation of Granite Mountain vein at Independence mine (ARDF number AN001), is 6 to 24 inches wide, strikes N10E, and dips 30 to 42 N. The Skyscraper vein (also known as the Smuggler-Union vein), is also seen in the Independence mine (ARDF number AN001), is 1.5 to 8 ft wide, strikes N 10 E, and dips 45 N (Ray, 1933). Both veins carry free gold, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and a little galena in quartz gangue. The veins are probably cut off by the same faults that are seen in the Gold Bullion mine (ARDF number AN004) (Ray, 1933). Recovery from the Homestake vein was about 1 oz/ton Au (Capps, 1915).   The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954).</td>
<td>   Discovered by Robert Hatcher, the Martin mine is the site of the first lode discovery in the district, 1906. Development included surface stripping, open cuts, and several tunnels, there was a mill, cyanide plant, and aerial tram onsite during active years. In 1911, some ore was milled at the Alaska Gold Quartz Mining Company (Independence mine ARDF number AN001) mill. The mine&#39;s own mill was installed in 1912 and enlarged with a cyanide plant added in 1914 (Capps, 1915). By 1918, 9 tunnels having aggregate length of 3,400 ft plus connecting stopes and winzes (Chapin, 1920). An unsuccessful attempt made by Brooklyn Development Co. (Kelly-Willow prospect ARDF number AN032) to undercut the veins with a 1,200 ft tunnel from the west side of Skyscraper Mountain. Abandoned prior to 1931 with the camp and surface plant being dismantled (Ray, 1933). Recovery from Homestake vein was about 1 oz/ton Au (Capps, 1915).</td>

<td>Low-sulfide Au-quartz veins (Cox and Singer, 1986; model 36a)</td>
<td>   The principal vein mined is in a shear zone as much as 25 ft wide in Late Cretaceous quartz diorite of the Willow Creek Pluton. The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Quartz is present along the foot wall and hanging wall which are separated by sheared quartz diorite, some of which is essentially unaltered. The vein strikes about N 10 W, and dips 30 to 42 W (Ray, 1933). Numerous other shear zones are present and are generally about 3 to 4 ft wide. These contain reticulating quartz veins and mineralized, altered quartz diorite (Chapin, 1920). Wall-rock alteration is intense and consists of replacement by the usual hydrothermal minerals in the district - chlorite, pyrite, sericite, ankerite, and a little calcite (Ray, 1933). Workings in the Gold Cord mine are probably the most difficult in the mining district. Due to the relatively greater number and arrangement of post-mineralization faults. The most important of the faults is the Gold Cord Fault, a major transverse fault striking N 65 W, and dipping 80 to 85 SW. This fault system is about 40 feet wide on the 100 and 400 levels but is 120 feet wide on the 200 level of the mine. The fault material is mostly comminuted, strongly altered quartz diorite. A number of minor transverse faults also cut the vein. These normal faults trend northwesterly and dip steeply to the northeast; displacements are generally less than 15 feet. The geology is further complicated by several normal and reverse faults (Ray, 1954). The property north of the Gold Cord Fault may prove favorable due to the absence of any major faults.   Ore grade ranged from about 0.1 to 9 oz/ton Au. Most assay values were between 0.75 and 4 oz/ton Au (converted from dollar values given in Ray (1933)). During a 1984 U.S. Bureau of Mines investigation (Kurtak, 1986), a 1.8-ft-wide sample across a quartz vein in the 4,900 ft adit (late 1940s workings) contained 13 ppm gold (0.38 oz/ton).</td>
<td>   First staked in 1915 by Byron and Charles Bartholf. Development work appears to have been sporadic for many years, records indicate &#39;real&#39; activity began around 1931 (Ray, 1954). By 1933 the camp consisted of a mill (crusher, 10-ton Denver mill, amalgamating plates, and a small concentration table), shops, and living quarters (Ray, 1933). The bulk of the gold produced from the mine was during the six year period from the winter of 1931 through 1937 (Stoll, 1997). Ray (1954) reports that the mine was developed by at least 2,500 ft of workings on several levels over a vertical distance of 200 ft. In 1947 and 1948 two veins near the top of the mountain above the Gold Cord mine were explored by drifting, but no significant amount of gold was found.     The property has been drilled in attempts to locate faulted-out sections of vein and prospect adits driven on other veins have not been particularly successful. The property north of Gold Cord Fault may prove favorable due to the absence of any major faults.   Ore grade ranged from about 0.1 to 9 oz/ton Au. Most assay values between 0.75 and 4 oz/ton Au (assay converted from dollar values reported by Ray, 1933). One batch of 11 tons of ore contained 10.9 oz (1 oz/ton) of gold (Brooks, 1925). During a 1984 U.S. Bureau of Mines investigation (Kurtak, 1986), a 1.8-ft-wide sample across a quartz vein in the 4,900 ft adit (late 1940s workings) contained 13 ppm gold (0.38 oz/ton).   In 1998, Dan Renshaw continued driving a new adit in search of favorable ore at the Gold Cord mine.</td>

<td>   Quartz vein, up to 10 ft thick, cuts the Late Cretaceous Willow Creek Pluton. The vein pinches, swells, and breaks up into narrow stringers along strike (Ray, 1933). Minerals in the vein include free gold, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, molybdenite, pyrite, sphalerite, unconfirmed tellurides and tetrahedrite. The strike of the vein is usually north and dip ranges from 23 to 66 W, with the most common dip between 35 and 45 W. Vein is offset by two parallel normal faults that strike N 55 W, and dip 74 NE (Ray, 1954). Some of the ore shoots are terminated by these faults. Rocks are reported to show right lateral displacement with net offsets of 100-150 ft. Movement in the fissure containing the vein was, based drag and offset of aplite dikes, reverse.   The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954).</td>
<td>   First staked in 1911. Development included open cuts and stripping which traced the vein for about 2,000 ft, plus at least 490 ft of underground workings most of which were below the main level. Site had mill, aerial tram, and a cyanide plant. Ore was taken to the mill by aerial tram, the tailings were saved for future treatment. Most of the mining was south of the Mabel fault, along a major transverse fault. Six tons of ore was shipped to Tacoma in 1912. Intermittent mining and development to 1917, mine produced continually from 1917-1930, and worked intermittently from 1931-1947. Ray (1933) indicated production probably worth more than $100,000 (about 4,840 fine oz of Au based on gold at $20.66/oz). Ray (1954) indicated that future development is likely to be expensive and difficult because of lack of data on faulting.</td>

<td>   Three quartz veins in parallel shear zones cut the Late Cretaceous Willow Creek Pluton. The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Shear zones all strike N 10 to 20 W, and dip about 40 SW. Numerous slickensides indicate a steep reverse movement which caused the hanging wall of the shear zone to move upward and to the south (Ray, 1954). Ankerite noted in wall rock and as inclusions in quartz veins (Ray, 1933). Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954). The thickest quartz stringer, up to 12 inches thick, produced a few tons of low-grade ore. One vein netted more than $1,200 (gold at $20.67/oz) from a one-ton ore shipment in 1930 (Ray, 1933).</td>

Quartz veins, up to 16 inches wide, and narrow quartz stringers are generally in east-trending, north-dipping shear zones. Four faults and sixteen shear zones have been exposed in workings. Pyrite, arsenopyrite, and chalcopyrite reported in quartz vein, but these sulfides make up less than 2 percent of veins. Up to 3.6 oz/ton Au, but commonly less than 0.5 oz/ton Au (Jasper, 1962).   The tonalite is part of the Willow Creek Pluton, a zoned pluton. The outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954).</td>
<td>   Explored by 474 ft of underground workings; 323 ft of crosscuts, 56 ft of drifts, 75 ft raise, and 20 ft winze to the surface were reported. In additon, surface cuts were present. Gold values were up to 3.6 oz/ton Au, but commonly less than 0.5 oz/ton Au (Jasper, 1962).</td>

<td>   The Gray Eagle and Gold Top veins are mentioned in Ray (1954) and Stoll (1997) but the information is limited. Stevens (2010) describes the vein, which probably probably was described previously under different names, in some detail. It has about the same orientation as the veins at the Lucky Shot Mine (AN002) and geologically is probably similar. Free gold is visible in the vein. The vein can be traced in trenches for at least 2,500 feet. It trends N 80 W to S 80 W and dips 50 to 60N. It is 12 inches to 8 feet wide and averages about 4 feet. The Smith tunnel that was driven sometime before 1940, intersected the vein and the workings follow it for about 850 feet. Forty samples were taken; the assays varied from low to 0.7 ounces of gold per ton (Stevens, 2010). In 1940, open cuts exposed the vein, the older trenches were cleaned out, and 2 short adits were driven to reach the vein. The rocks in the area are tonalite to quartz diorite of the Willow Creek pluton, dated at 73-74 Ma (Madden-Mcguire and others, 1989).   Before 1940, Milo Kelly  of Knik, Alaska recovered about 60 ounces of gold from a few hundred pounds of ore mined from shallow workings on the Gray Eagle property (Vinal, 1940). The mine is now part of the property being explored by the Harmony Gold Corporation (Stevens, 2010) but in early 2010, there is no indication of any recent work on the Gold Top/Gray Eagle vein.</td>
<td>   Sometime prior to 1940, there was considerable trenching and an adit intersected the Gold Top/Gray Eagle vein. About 850 feet of drifts exposed the vein. In 1940, more trenches were dug, the old trenches were rehabilitated, and two short adits were driven to the vein. Since 2005, the property has been part of a large block of claims that is being explored by Harmony Gold Corporation, but as of early 2010, there was no evidence of work work on the Gray Eagle/Gold Top vein.</td>

The first is a quartz vein exposed in a tributary on the divide between Craigie Creek and Purches Creek drainages (Capps and Tuck locality 4). The vein is 1 ft wide, strikes S 20 W, and dips 30 S, and can be traced for several hundred feet. It is composed of &#39;bull&#39; quartz and contains chalcopyrite, gold, and silver. The second occurrence is a crushed piece of quartz float from the next tributary to the west (Capps and Tuck locality 5). It contained disseminated pyrite, gold, and silver. At the first locality described above, assays show the vein to contain 0.16 oz/ton Au and 0.2 oz/ton Ag. At the second locality described, the quartz float assayed 0.01 oz/ton Au and 0.2 oz/ton Ag.   These occurrences are located near the contact of the Willow Creek Pluton and an early Paleocene and Late Cretaceous granite body. The Willow Creek Pluton is a Late Cretaceous zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. The early Paleocene and Late Cretaceous granite is generally a biotite-muscovite granite with granodiorite and lesser quartz monzonite. Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954).</td>

<td>   Late Cretaceous tonalite of the Willow Creek Pluton contains a sheared composite quartz vein and pegmatite dike. The vein strikes N 77 W, and dips 26 NE. The central quartz zone consists of a 6 ft central band of quartz bounded by a 1 ft pegmatite hanging wall and a 16 in pegmatite footwall (Ray, 1954). Pegmatite dike shows that reopening took place after consolidation of pegmatite. Glassy quartz was then deposited between pegmatite walls. The quartz and pegmatite again fractured; chalcopyrite, bornite, and pyrite were deposited in fractures and replaced orthoclase in pegmatite (Ray, 1933). Quartz contains stringers of sulfides, including an unidentified bismuth? mineral, up to 1 ft long, but less than 2 inches thick (Ray, 1954). Quartz float contains disseminated molybdenite flakes and free gold (Capps and Tuck, 1935).   The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite.

The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. The dikes have been described as both aplitic and pegmatitic and locally carry a few unnamed black minerals, hornblende, and tourmaline. The veins trend N 75 E and tend to pinch and swell. The veins that follow conjugate fractures in the quartz diorite are 12 to 18 inches thick, with a maximum width of 5 to 8 ft. The veins not following the dike contain considerable gold, averaging nearly 5 oz/ton Au. The pyrite in the veins have mostly been leached, leaving cubical cavities (Capps, 1915). A 30 inch thick vein follows the dike, but no reports of content are available (Brooks, 1925). Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954).

The mine was inaccessible in 1950 (Ray, 1954).  An average grade of 5 oz/ton Au was reported for the veins cross-cutting the dike (Capps, 1915). By 1933, the Talkeetna mine was undercut by, but not connected with, the workings of the Fern mine (ARDF number AN005). The same company, Fern Gold Mining Company, owned both the Talkeetna mine and Fern mine by about 1925.   A surface grab sample of the vein walls, collected by the U.S. Bureau of Mines, contained 0.57 g/ton Au (0.017 oz/ton Au) (Kurtak, 1986).</td>

The ore plays out where vein rolls upward into a shear zone, south of the mine (Ray, 1954).   The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954).</td>

The coarsely crystalline quartz vein carries gold; the tellurides nagyagite, altaite, and coloradoite(?); galena in large cubes; pyrite; sphalerite; chalcopyrite; and tetrahedrite. The vein strikes N 70 E and dips 21 to 34 NW. The main vein is crossed by a barren copper-stained quartz vein. Ore deposition was apparently localized at the vein intersections. Nagyagite is an important mineral in that free gold shows a preference to it, especially in the richer ore. Some nagyagite and gold deposition appear to be contemporaneous (Ray, 1954).   The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite.

<td>Low-sulfide Au-quartz veins (Cox and Singer, 1986; model 36a).</td>
<td>   At the Nippon Mine (the Jap Mine in early reports), there are two parallel veins 6 inches to 2 feet thick and about 300 feet apart (Roehm, 1938; Stoll, 1997; Stevens, 2010). Five tunnels exposed the veins in several places for a total length of more than 700 feet. The upper vein is exposed in two short tunnels; the lower vein is exposed in two other tunnels. There is little detailed geologic information about the Nippon veins. But they are probably similar to the other veins in the Willow Creek district and consist of  low-sulfide quartz veins with a few percent pyrite, arsenopyrite, and galena; follow shear zones; and free gold is often visible. Elsewhere in the district and probably here, wallrock alteration is intense within a few inches of the veins, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and chloritization (Ray, 1954). The veins cut tonalite to quartz diorite of the Willow Creek pluton which has been dated at 73-74 Ma (Stevens, 2010, Madden-Mcguire and others, 1988).   The Nippon Mine was discovered between 1909 and 1914 (Roehm, 1938;  Stoll, 1997). A single stamp mill was installed before 1915 and there may have been some minor production. According to Brooks (1925), no attempt was made to mine ore that contained less than 4.85 ounces of gold per ton. In 1937, a miner was milling 200 to 300 pounds of high-grade ore from a 10-inch vein. Three vertical diamond drill holes were drilled in 1941; samples contained up to 1.88 ounces of gold per ton.   In the early 1980s, Ensearch  Exploration Inc. drilled the upper and lower veins from the old underground workings Stevens, 2010). The work was suspended when the veins to found to be highly fractured. Ensearch&#39;s best intercept contained 3.32 ounces of gold per ton. As a result of this limited drilling, Hawley and Visconty (1982) outlined a 6,000-ton block of high grade ore. Yongue (1989) thought there may have been a reserve of 17,100 tons of material in the upper vein with a grade of 0.380 ounce of gold per ton  and 2,272 tons of of material in the lower vein with a grade of 0.9 ounce per ton.</td>
<td>   The workings include five adits and more than 700 feet of  drifts on two veins. A small mill was installed in 1915  and there may have been some gold produced. (Capps, 1916). There was minor production in 1937 by one miner and 3 holes were diamond drilled in 1941. Ensearch Exploration Ltd. drilled 7 holes in the early 1980s and sampled and mapped the property.</td>

Owners reported five mineralized veins on the property. One mineralized vein is probably the Independence vein; projection of the vein to the surface would be on patented claims of the Independence mine (ARDF number AN001).   The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling.

<td>   Capps (1915) reported a 1 to 18 inch wide gougy quartz vein cuts the Late Cretaceous Willow Creek Pluton. The quartz vein strikes N 24 W, and dips 36 W, and consists of solid quartz, associated with some clayey gouge. The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. The vein and host are oxidized to depths of 30 ft (Capps, 1915). Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954).</td>
<td>   Developed by several large open cuts and an inclined 30 ft adit. In 1911 a few tons of ore from the property was milled in the mill of the Alaska Gold Quartz Mining Co., (the Independence mine - ARDF number AN001) and yielded the first gold produced from this mine. Reportedly in 1912 about 100 tons of ore was dragged down a trail to a point from which it could be trammed to the mill (Capps, 1915). Stoll (1997) indicated that in the summer of 1939 the old shaft was reopened and retimbered by Alaska Pacific Consolidated Mining Co., and shipments of near-surface quartz were sent down to the old mill. In July the following summer the shaft was deepened, staying beneath the Eldorado vein. A raise to the vein and a drift northward along it were driven, finding ore with gold values good enough for the mill. By the summer of 1941 further exploration at Eldorado was &#39;outranked&#39; by other ore-hunting plans.</td>

Two small hydropowered mills were being planned in the summer of 1914. Stoll (1997) indicated that the mills were never delivered, possibly due to the onset of WWI. By 1919, the old workings had mostly caved.  Sampling conducted in the mid-1940s turned up promising gold values, hinting that the prospect was a &#39;sleeper&#39; (Stoll and McDonald, 1946). In 1984, miners were reopening a caved area to access old stopes which reportedly still contained ore.   In 1984, the U.S. Bureau of Mines collected a 100 pound bulk sample from the surface ore dump.

Exploration encountered four shear zones, two of which contained gold in quartz lenses in gouge and sheared rock. The shear zones generally strike northeast and dip 52 to 70 NW. Two shear zones were barren, one yielded a few good assays, and one had encouraging assays (Ray, 1954).

<td>Low-sulfide Au-quartz veins (Cox and Singer, 1986; model 36a)</td>
<td>   Two parallel veins have been traced in the quartz diorite country rock of the Late Cretaceous Willow Creek Pluton. The veins strike N 50 E, and dip 50 NW. The upper vein is 3 to 4 ft wide and consists of quartz and gouge in altered quartz diorite. The lower vein is 3 to 5 ft wide and consists of quartz stringers and gouge in altered quartz diorite. Both veins carry pyrite and free gold, and reportedly are cut by faults (Chapin, 1921).   The Willow Creek Pluton is a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954).</td>

Stringers and veins contain free gold, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and the tellurides nagyagite and altaite. Veins strike N 35 to 50 W, and dips 40 to 62 SW. One vein is displaced several feet along a transverse fault (Ray, 1933; Ray, 1954).

This could indicate a post-Eocene age for mineralization of Lonesome mine gold deposits, because it may be younger than the Eocene continental rocks overlying the batholith of the Willow Creek district. A 2 to 3 inch vein of quartz assayed 19 oz/ton Au and 22 oz/ton Ag. The same vein is exposed and oxidized at surface and shows 400 oz/ton Ag (Ray, 1954).</td>
<td>   Developed by surface trenching and several hundred feet of underground workings on 3 levels. By 1921 a tunnel was being driven on the upper vein and surface pits were being dug on the lower veins (Chapin, 1921). By 1922 the underground workings totaled 435 ft of adit, crosscut, shaft and raise. Mill was running in 1922 (Brooks and Capps, 1924). A five-stamp mill stood beside the Little Susitna River in the early 1930s. From 1946 to 1949 a new mill was installed  and some underground development was done. The new mill and camp were built around 1946 although two five-stamp mills still stood in the old mill building (Stoll, 1997). The mine operated intermittently until 1949.     A 2 to 3 inch vein of quartz assayed 19 oz/ton Au and 22 oz/ton Ag. The same vein is exposed and oxidized at surface and shows 400 oz/ton Ag (Ray, 1954). There is considerably more silver in these veins than in other veins of the district.</td>

<td>   Chapin (1921) reported that three parallel granitic dikes cut tonalite country rock. The dikes are composed of quartz, orthoclase, and clusters of tourmaline. They strike N 63 E and one of these dikes, 8 ft wide, gradually passes along its strike into a quartz vein. The vein carries some gold and visible particles of chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite. Several short, intersecting gash veins of quartz intersect this main vein with considerable pyrite. These veins pinch out a short distance from the main fissure, but the persistence of the fissure vein is unknown. It appears to merge into a granite dike in one direction and is untracable due to debris (talus or glacial deposits ?) in the other direction.   The bedrock is the Late Cretaceous Willow Creek Pluton, a zoned pluton: the outer part consists of hornblende quartz diorite and lesser hornblende tonalite; the core consists of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and lesser hornblende-biotite quartz monzodiorite and biotite quartz monzonite. Wall-rock alteration within a few inches of the veins is intense, but seldom extends more than 10 to 12 inches beyond the quartz filling. Sericitization and carbonate alteration predominate, but there is some pyritization and in the outer parts of the alteration zone chloritization is present (Ray, 1954).</td>
